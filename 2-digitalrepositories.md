# On Repositories

A repository is a place to store and manage digital content. Additionally, many repositories display content as well a preserve it. Repositories play a key role in the dissemination of open access content, particularly for types of content that haven't traditionally had distribution platforms. Repositories are also the cornerstone of the *green open access* model, where versions of published materials are made accessible by other means like post-print or pre-print. 

Repositories come in a few shapes and sizes, and through a variety of different software platforms. You're likely to see the following:


- **Institutional Repositories** // Many academic institutions have their own digital repository for storing and sharing the research output of their faculty, staff, and students. 
- **Digital Collections Repositories** // Similarly, a number of institutions have repositories containing archival or unique materials that have been digitized and made available for the public online.
- **Subject/Discipline-Based Repositories** // Outside of the purview of specific institutions, some repositories represent certain fields of practice or study and collect/share materials by discipline. 
- **Research Data Repositories** // Many types of repository software have yet to tackle the challenges unique to displaying and sharing research data. However, the number of research data repositories are growing and they aim to make research data as open for reuse as possible.
