# About This Document

This GitBook is designed to be an open, flexible, and adaptive document maintained primarily by members of the CAUL/CBUA Scholarly Communications Committee. GitBook was chosen for a number of reasons: 

* Collaborative authoring features;
* Git-based version control;
* Translation support;
* GitHub-integration allowing for customized, institutional versioning from forked instances of the document; 
* Easily modifiable and convertable text from Markdown.

Original publication of this GitBook occurred in October 2015, to coincide with [Open Access Week](http://www.openaccessweek.org/). However, beyond the original release of the document in Fall 2015, the hope is that it will continue to grow as a resource with guidance from the Scholarly Communications Committee. As the role of libraries changes in response to digital scholarship trends, it will no doubt be necessary to update this document to reflect those changing trends, services, and resources.
