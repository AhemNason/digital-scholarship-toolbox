# The Canadian Tri-Agency Policy on Open Access Publications

Although the Canadian Institute for Health Research (CIHR) has had an open access policy since 2008, it wasn't until 2014 that all three of the primary research funding bodies in Canada (CIHR, NSERC and SSHRC) implemented a joint open access policy. 

Known as the [Tri-Agency Open Access Policy on Publications](http://www.science.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&n=F6765465-1), the Policy requires that funded authors make their research articles openly available within 12 months of publications.

###Key points:

- Open access can be achieved either by gold/hybrid open access (the article is open at the point of publication) or via green open access (the article is deposited into a subject or institutional repository).

- Article processing charges (APCs), if required for making the article open, are now considered eligible expenses by all three funders.
