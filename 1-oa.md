#On Open Access

The Open Access (OA) movement is based on the principle that the products of academic research should be freely accessible to everyone. And, behind this principle is the idea that the spirit of scholarly study is spreading knowledge in order to improve society for everyone. In reality, academic journals can be very expensive and huge portions of scholarship are inaccessible to the public. While it's fairly common for folks to apply this to peer-reviewed journal articles, OA can apply to documents like theses, conference proceedings, presentations, learning objects, research data and many others. 

Open Access comes in a variety of flavours. There's *gratis open access*, which is freely available content. There's also *libre open access*, which is content that comes with rights for reuse. You'll also commonly hear about *green*, *gold*, and *hybrid* open access which can refer to the economic model and/or form of distribution of content. 

That said, there are plenty of excellent descriptions of open access out there, so rather than reinventing the wheel, please check out these great resources:

Although the Canadian Institute for Health Research (CIHR) has had an open access policy since 2008, it wasn't until 2014 that all three of the primary research funding bodies in Canada (CIHR, NSERC and SSHRC) implemented a joint open access policy. 

Known as the [Tri-Agency Open Access Policy on Publications](http://www.science.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&n=F6765465-1), the Policy requires that funded authors make their research articles openly available within 12 months of publications.

###Key points:

- Open access can be achieved either by gold/hybrid open access (the article is open at the point of publication) or via green open access (the article is deposited into a subject or institutional repository).

- Article processing charges (APCs), if required for making the article open, are now considered eligible expenses by all three funders.

The Tri-Agency's [FAQ](http://www.science.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&n=A30EBB24-1) is an excellent place to get useful information about this Policy.
