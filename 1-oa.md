#On Open Access

The Open Access (OA) movement is based on the principle that the products of academic research should be freely accessible to everyone. 

##What is it?

Potential topics:

 - Green vs. Gold vs. Platinum (no APCs)
 - Predatory journals?
 - Hybrid OA

##Why should I care? 

##Canadian context

Although the Canadian Institute for Health Research (CIHR) has had an open access policy since 2008, it wasn't until 2014 that all three of the primary research funding bodies in Canada (CIHR, NSERC and SSHRC) implemented a joint open access policy. Known as the Tri-Agency Open Access Policy on Publications, this policy requires that funded authors make their research articles openly available within 12 months of publications.

- Green or gold allowed;
- authors fees claimable;
- acceptable repositories
