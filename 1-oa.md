#On Open Access

So much has been written on open access. Like, so many things. 

##What is it?

Potential topics:

 - Green vs. Gold
 - Predatory journals?
 - ???

##Why should I care? 

##Will anyone listen?

##Canadian context

Should we include content on Canadian Tri-Agency requirements for Open Access?

- Green or gold allowed;
- authors fees claimable;
- acceptable repositories
