#On Open Access

The Open Access (OA) movement is based on the principle that the products of academic research should be freely accessible to everyone. 

##What is it?

Potential topics:

 - Green vs. Gold vs. Platinum (no APCs)
 - Predatory journals?
 - Hybrid OA

##Why should I care? 

##Canadian context

Should we include content on Canadian Tri-Agency requirements for Open Access?

- Green or gold allowed;
- authors fees claimable;
- acceptable repositories
