#On Open Access

The Open Access (OA) movement is based on the principle that the products of academic research should be freely accessible to everyone. 

There are plenty of good descriptions of open access out there, so rather than write our own, here are a few:

- [The Wikipedia entry on open access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access)
- [Peter Suber's overview of open access](http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/overview.htm)

##What is it?

Potential topics:

 - Green vs. Gold vs. Platinum (no APCs)
 - Predatory journals?
 - Hybrid OA

##Why should I care? 

##Canadian context

Although the Canadian Institute for Health Research (CIHR) has had an open access policy since 2008, it wasn't until 2014 that all three of the primary research funding bodies in Canada (CIHR, NSERC and SSHRC) implemented a joint open access policy. 

Known as the [Tri-Agency Open Access Policy on Publications](http://www.science.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&n=F6765465-1), the Policy requires that funded authors make their research articles openly available within 12 months of publications.

###Key points:

- Open access can be achieved either by gold/hybrid open access (the article is open at the point of publication) or via green open access (the article is deposited into a subject or institutional repository).

- Article processing charges (APCs), if required for making the article open, are now considered eligible expenses by all three funders.

The Tri-Agency's [FAQ](http://www.science.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&n=A30EBB24-1) is an excellent place to get useful information about this Policy.
