# Mandates and Policies

Researchers looking to locate either publisher, or funding agency policies have two excellent resources to turn to, [SHERPA/RoMEO](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/), and [SHERPA/JULIET](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/juliet/). Of course, it's also possible that your institution might have an OA mandate as well, and it's worth checking with your Office of Research Services or your library to see any applicable policies. 

**[SHERPA/RoMEO](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/)**

SHERPA/RoMEO is a database hosted by the University of Nottingham that seeks to contain up-to-date open access policies for as many academic journals as possible. Users can search the database for a specific journal to find out what their rights are in terms of sharing their research. 

**[SHERPA/JULIET](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/juliet/)**

SHERPA/JULIET  is another University of Nottingham database that contains up-to-date open access mandates and requirements for as many funding agencies as possible. Users can search the database for a specific funding agency in order to determine their open access requirements.
