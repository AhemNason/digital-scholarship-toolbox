# Evaluating Journals

With shifting mandates and journal policies, it is certainly possible that some researchers will be looking for new places to publish their work. The landscape is filled with potential journals, both OA and subscription-based, with varying degrees of trustworthiness and impact. 

Looking for a journal in which to submit research can be stressful. This guide is intended to help with the process, whether you're a fresh graduate student looking to be published for the first time or a tenured professor looking for greener pastures. 

## Finding an Appropriate Journal 

### Establish whether the journal's website and emails seems professional:
- Respectable spelling, grammar, punctuation? 
- Is journal description well-crafted? Does it display an advanced understanding of the matter?
- Contact information is given? Does it appear complete and credible?
- Editor and editorial board listed? Are these recognized experts in the field?
- ISSN listed?
- Publishes regularly? Decent number of articles in each issue? Issues and articles easy to find and access on the website?
- Peer reviewed? Uses accepted peer review processes for this discipline?
- Clearly indicates whether APCs (author processing charges) will be applied for accepted manuscripts.

###Look for qualitative signs of reliability and respectability:
*Note*: Use whichever tools are at your disposal at your institution.

Check for peer review info, e.g.:
  
   * [Ulrichsweb]

Check for respected metrics (research any others that are listed on the website to assess credibility):

  * [Journal Citation Reports]
  * [Web of Science]
  * [Eigenfactor]
  * [SCImago Journal Rank]
  * [Google Scholar Metrics]
  * [altmetrics] tools

Check for affiliation with respected industry associations, e.g.: 

  * [COPE]
  * [CSE]
  * [ICMJE]
  * [OASPA] (if OA journal)
  * Indexed in [DOAJ] (if OA journal)

Search the web to find any potentially alarming information about this journal or publisher, including:

  * discussions about this specific journal (if possible, discussions between researchers in this field — their opinion may carry more weight);
  * discussions about the same publisher but not necessarily the same journal; 
  * [Beall's list] (use with caution).

####How to Craft Your Response to the Faculty Member:
#####The Intro Disclaimer:
- Something along the lines of: "Unfortunately, there's no magic list that can tell you which journals are Good or Bad";
- Impact factors and other metrics only show you part of the picture;
- [Beall's list] should not be taken as gospel – while it does shed light on uncouth practices by publishers, it also includes emerging journals that have not had a chance to prove themselves, and is particularly critical of publishers that are not based in Western countries (see [Berger and Cirasella], [Crawford]);
- A lot of things will impact your decision to publish in a journal: your discipline, where you’re at in your career, what you want out of a publication, how quickly you want your article published;
