Welcome to the CAUL/CBUA SCC **Digital Scholarship Toolbox**, an open, online resource for CAUL/CBUA institution faculty, staff, and students. That's already a lot of information, so let's unpack it. 

- [CAUL/CBUA](http://www.caul-cbua.ca/) stands for the Council of Atlantic University Libraries / Conseil des bibliothèques universitaires de l’Atlantique. It is a collaborative partnership of 19 post-secondary libraries in Atlantic Canada. 
- [SCC](http://www.caul-cbua.ca/committee/scholarlycomms) stands for the Scholarly Communications Committee, which is made up of members of CAUL/CBUA institution librarians involved in scholarly communications initiatives. 
- **Digital Scholarship** incorporates a number of themes related and/or adjacent to scholarly communication, including: 
   - open access
   - digital repositories
   - digital curation
   - digital copyright and publishing
   - author's rights and publishing
   - digital preservation
- A **Toolbox ** is a box of tools. Like, for helping to do things. 

*Whew*. This [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) is an attempt at creating a generalized resource for faculty, students, and staff of CAUL/CBUA institutions as a collaborative effort from the members of the CAUL/CBUA Scholarly Communications Committee.
